# Animal HealthGuard üêæ

Welcome to Animal HealthGuard, where we deploy advanced technologies to safeguard the well-being of animals by early detection and intervention in the face of diseases.

## Problem

The health of animals is vital, yet early detection of diseases in animals is often challenging. Timely identification is crucial for effective treatment and preventing the spread of illnesses. Traditional methods fall short, leaving animals vulnerable to undetected health issues.

## Solution

Animal HealthGuard is not just a project; it's a commitment to ensuring the health and welfare of our animal companions. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we've developed a robust system for early disease detection, providing timely insights to veterinarians, caretakers and pet-parents to detect the problem at home itself.

## Technologies Used

### Image Recognition üì∏
- TensorFlow: Powering our image recognition model to identify subtle signs of diseases through images of animals.
- OpenCV: Enhancing image processing capabilities for precise and accurate diagnosis.

### Machine Learning ü§ñ
- Scikit-learn: Employing machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and trend analysis in animal health data.

### Frontend üåê
- React.js: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for veterinarians and caretakers to access and interpret health data.

### Real-Time Monitoring ‚è±Ô∏è
- MQTT Protocol: Enabling real-time communication for immediate alerts and updates on the health status of animals.
